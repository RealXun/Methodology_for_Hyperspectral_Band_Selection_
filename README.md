# Exploration of a Methodology for Hyperspectral Band Selection using XGBoost and PCA

## Idea of this project
The classification of hyperspectral images involves utilizing multiple features to identify and classify each pixel's content accurately. PCA is a mathematical technique that reduces the dimensionality of hyperspectral images by identifying the most significant patterns of variability.
    
This paper aims to evaluate the effectiveness of Principal Component Analysis (PCA) based band selection for hyperspectral image classification using XGBoost feature importance scores.
    
To ensure that PCA uses the best set of bands to explain the variation, bands are proactively removed in the feature selection chain before dimensionality reduction. 
    
The paper details the techniques employed, including XGBoost feature importance scoring. Additionally, a flowchart is included to illustrate the process in its entirety.
    
The results demonstrate that the algorithm effectively reduces the number of bands while preserving crucial spectral data. This results in a slight decrease in the number of principal components, indicating the algorithm's effectiveness in locating and removing unwanted bands. The performance comparison across all four datasets shows a slight gain in accuracy, with some datasets having a more pronounced improvement. The suggested methodology generates a list of bands to be removed before PCA to improve classification accuracy.
    
Overall, this method shows promise in improving the accuracy of HS image classification and offers opportunities for future research, such as investigating alternative feature importance analysis techniques and extending the approach to other tree-based machine learning algorithms.

## Objectives

  1 -To investigate the effectiveness of incorporating preemptive band removal into Principal Component Analysis (PCA), with the main focus on optimizing accuracy over the reliability of explained variance.

  2 -To employ XGBoost to generate scores for each band and to utilize these scores to determine the optimal sequence for band removal before PCA.

  3 -To comprehensively compare the proposed algorithm with a conventional PCA application, providing a detailed, step-by-step description of the feature selection process for potential future research and analysis.

**There are two easy ways to run the code and see the results**

**- For Microsoft Windows Systems:**

Using VisualStudioCode and run a Jupyter notebook (Recommended): The Jupyter notebook is called "PCA_band_removal.ipynb" and is located inside the folder named "notebooks": The notebook is divided into cells (some have text while other have code). Each cell can be executed using `Shift + Enter`.

Executing text cells does nothing and executing code cells runs the code and produces it's output. 

To execute the whole notebook, run all cells in order. 

When you execute the whole notebook it will first run Pavia University dataset, then Pavia Center dataset, then Salinas dataset and last Indian Pines dataset.

You could run the first six cells to import the libraries, load the datasets, the main function and then run one of the datasets independently.


**- For Linux Systems:**

Running the python file named "hsi_pca(Linux_Only).py": It will show you a short menu where you can choose which dataset you want to use.

## Conclusion and Future works Section Writing

This study proposes a band selection approach for HS image classification that combines XBoost feature importance analysis with PCA to improve accuracy while reducing the computational cost. By removing the least important bands and applying PCA to the remaining ones, the proposed methodology is able to retain critical information while also reducing the dimensionality of the dataset. This approach can have a significant impact in various fields where HS imaging is commonly used, such as agriculture and medical imaging. It essentially helps to improve classification during the previous feature selection and dimensionality reduction phases, providing a flat increase in accuracy before hyperparameter tuning and model training, which in turn can lead to improved decision-making and overall better results.

The use of XGBoost with the histogram algorithm is an important step in the methodology, as it reduces the computational cost by approximating the gradients using histograms. This is significant because the process trains multiple models, so any reduction in terms of computational cost when training has a large effect.
Throughout this research work, numerous challenges have been addressed. During experimentation, it has been necessary to determine an appropriate amount of variance to retain in the PCA transformation. Since HS images often contain a large number of highly correlated spectral bands, it is important to retain enough variance to capture the important information. This has been solved by observing different variance thresholds and selecting the one that produces a high accuracy while still requiring a manageable number of components. Finding the absolute optimal variance threshold is not critical for the experimentation since the aim is to use the algorithm to improve accuracy relative to applying PCA and XGBoost in a conventional way with the same parameters. Another challenge has been reproducibility and coherence through iterations since multiple XGBoost models and splits are used during the process. This has been solved by using a fixed seed that remains constant across the algorithm loops.

The proposed methodology offers several future opportunities for research. One possibility is to explore alternative feature importance analysis techniques to identify the most important bands before the removal process. Another avenue for research is to investigate the impact of different variance thresholds. The list of removed bands is also worthy of further research since looking at the reasons why removing them increases accuracy can help understand the underlying difficulties that those bands cause to PCA during dimensionality reduction, which ultimately leads to a reduction in accuracy. Additionally, this approach could be extended to other machine learning algorithms that are tree-based, namely decision trees or random forests.
